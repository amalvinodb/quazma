technical task

The function is named foo as it was in the task discription. 
The function takes in 2 parameters string and number.
At first the number is checked to see if it satisfies the condetion and returns false if it dose and if it dose not it will continue with the code.
Then a for loop itrates across each character to see if it is not a number or a space.
If the codetion is true the character is added to the output variable. 
If it fails the number is added to the character after converting it into an integer type.
The function continues to itrate and finaly returns back the result after it is done.

some test case login is done to check the working of the code
